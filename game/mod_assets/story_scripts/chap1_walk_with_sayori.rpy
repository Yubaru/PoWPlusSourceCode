"The moment I step outside, the fresh air hits me. It’s disgusting. Way too crisp, way too clean. It feels like a personal insult to my current physical state."
j "Alright, let's get this over with. Just a standard walk to—"
s "Heeeyyyy! Jackooo! Wait up!"
"I freeze. That voice. It’s like a sunbeam wrapped in a megaphone, drilling directly into the base of my skull."

"I turn around to see Sayori sprinting down the sidewalk, waving her arms like she’s trying to guide a crashing 747 onto the pavement."
j "Oh boy. Here we go. The chaos has arrived."
s 1a "Hah... hah... I caught you! You were totally gonna leave without me, weren't you?"
j "I wasn't 'leaving without you,' I was just 'leaving.' My existence doesn't revolve around your snooze button, Sayori."
s 4q "Ehehe, you're so mean! But I forgive you because I'm sleepy too."
"She looks at me, squinting. I probably still have ramen dust visible on my collar. It's a badge of honor."
s 1b "Wait, what's that smell? Is that... chicken bouillon?"
j "It's the scent of a champion, Sayori. Don't worry about it. It’s the smell of the grind."
s 4x "You ate dry ramen for breakfast again, didn't you?! Jacko, that's so bad for you! You need a real breakfast!"
j "Water is for the weak. Boiling is for people with too much free time. Now come on, if we don't move, we're gonna be late for Monika's poster debut."
s 1a "Oh! Right! The festival is today! I'm so excited to see the club's booth!"
j "Don't remind me. If one of these posters gets even a single smudge on it before we get to the third floor, Monika is going to have my head on a pike. And she’d be right to do it."
s 1q "Ehehe, she wouldn't do that! She's too nice! Besides, you worked really hard on them, right?"
j "Hard enough to deserve a Nobel Prize. Or at least a solid six hours of unconsciousness."
"As we walk, my tongue feels like it's been sandpapered. That raw ramen was a religious experience, but I need something to wash down the salt and the regret."
j "Hey, hold up. I need to hit the convenience store real quick before my heart stops from a sodium-induced stroke."
s 4r "Ooh! Snacks! Can I get something too?"
j "If you can keep up. Move it."

"We duck into the local convenience store. The bell chimes, signaling the arrival of two very sleep-deprived individuals and one massive internal headache."
j "Alright, let's see. What's gonna keep me alive until the festival starts..."
"I scan the drinks. Coffee? Too sophisticated. Water? Boring as hell. My eyes land on a can that looks like it was designed by a heavy metal band in the middle of a fever dream."
j "There we go. 'Nuclear Battery' energy drink. 400mg of caffeine, zero calories, and enough artificial sweetener to kill a toddler."

s "Jacko, that looks like it glows in the dark! Are you sure you should drink that?"
j "It's either this or I pass out during the poetry readings and fall face-first into the punch bowl. It’s for the club, Sayori."
"I grab the drink and another pack of Ed Speds. Sayori, meanwhile, is staring longingly at a shelf of chocolate chip cookies like they’re her long-lost family."
j "Just get the cookies, Sayori. I'm paying. Don't make it weird."
s 4p "Really?! Yay! You're the best, Jacko!"

"The cashier, a guy who looks like he hasn't slept since the late 90s, stares at my energy drink and then at my eyes, probably looking for signs of impending cardiac arrest."
"Cashier" "You know that stuff is banned in three countries, right? And it's not even legal in the US."
j "Make it four. I'm taking this one to the head. Besides, what's it to you? You selling poison or health food?"
"He sighs, clearly not paid enough to care, rings us up, and we step back out into the blinding sun."
j "The fuck was he bitch-ass talking about? I'm not even from the US. Mind your own business and sell the chemicals."
s 4m "Jacko, you're so mean! He was just trying to help!"

"I crack open the energy drink. It tastes like battery acid, liquid lightning, and pure industrial waste. It’s perfect."
j "God, that's disgusting. Give me another sip."

s 1a "You're so weird! How can you eat raw ramen and then drink... whatever that is?"
j "It’s a lifestyle, Sayori. You wouldn't understand the grind. You’re all sunshine and rainbows; I’m salt and caffeine."
"I take a handful of Ed Speds and shove them into my mouth. The spicy kick mixes with the chemical tang of the drink. My brain feels like it’s being jump-started with a pair of rusty cables."
j "Look at this. Peak performance. I can see through time, Sayori."
s 4q "Ehehe! You're gonna see through the floor if you don't slow down! Here, have a cookie to balance out all that... whatever is in that can."
"She holds out a chocolate chip cookie. It looks dangerously wholesome."
j "Get that away from me. Sugar is a crutch for the weak. I operate on spite and synthetic stimulants."
s 1d "Aww, but they're so soft! And you're always so grumpy when you're hungry."
j "I'm not hungry. I'm 'efficiently fueled.' There's a difference."
"We start walking through the park. It's filled with other students carrying boxes of supplies for the festival. They all look so... organized. So functional. It's sickening."
s 1b "I still can't believe you're actually in the club for the festival this year. Remember how you joined?"
j "How could I forget? You practically tackled me in the hallway and threatened to tell everyone I still sleep with a nightlight if I didn't show up. That’s low-key extortion, you know."
s 4q "Ehehe! I would never actually do that! I just knew you were lonely and needed some friends!"
j "I wasn't lonely, I was peaceful. But then Monika saw me drawing in the back of the room and suddenly I'm the 'Lead Visual Designer.' Fancy name for 'Monika's personal errand boy.'"
s 1a "But you're so good at it! Look at these posters! You and Monika make a great team."
j "Yeah, well, she's the brains and I'm the... guy who can tolerate the smell of permanent markers until I start seeing visions."
"Thinking about Monika makes my head spin faster than the caffeine. She smells like heaven and looks even better."
"I'm walking next to Sayori, but my mind is already in that club room. My heart is racing, and it's not just the Nuclear Battery."
s 1q "Do you think Monika will like the extra decorations I suggested?"
j "Knowing her? She'll probably find a way to make them look like they belong in a museum. She has that effect on things. And people."
s 4a "Ooh? What kind of effect does she have on you, Jacko?"
"I feel my face heat up. It’s definitely the caffeine. Or the spicy crackers. Definitely not the question."
j "The effect of making me work for free, Sayori. Now shut up and eat your cookies."
"Suddenly, a group of 'normal' students walks past, laughing about their sports club booth. I instinctively clutch the poster tube tighter, like they’re gonna try and jump me for it."
j "Look at them. Not a single care in the world. They probably had eggs and toast for breakfast like functional members of society. Must be nice."
s 1d "Aww, Jacko, don't be like that! Everyone is just excited for the festival!"
j "Excitement is just stress with a better marketing team, Sayori. Don't buy into the hype."
"Every bounce she takes makes my head rattle. I can feel my pulse in my eyelashes now. The caffeine is reaching critical mass."
s 1q "I'm just glad the festival is finally here! Everyone is going to love the club!"
j "Yeah, well, as long as I don't have to read anything out loud, I'll consider it a win. If Monika tries to put me on stage, I'm faking a medical emergency."
s 4m "Jacko! That's horrible!"
j "It's called 'Exit Strategy,' Sayori. Look it up."
"We turn the corner toward the school, the salt from the ramen and the burn of the energy drink keeping me on a razors edge. Today is gonna be a long day, but at least I'll get to be in the same room as Monika."

"We finally make it to the courtyard. The place is a zoo. A loud, colorful, irritating zoo."
"I feel like a target. One clumsy freshman with a stack of flyers could ruin weeks of work in a split second."
j "Target in sight. I just need to get through the lobby without getting tackled by an overexcited mascot."

s 1a "Oh! Jacko, I just remembered! I have to go get one more thing from a classroom before the festival starts."
j "Wait, you're leaving me? In this crowd? With the precious cargo? You're a traitor, Sayori."
s 4q "Ehehe, you'll be fine! You're a big strong visual designer! I'll meet you and everyone else in the club room as soon as I'm done!"
"She starts backing away, her eyes already glazing over as she spots a tray of cookies in the distance."
s 1b "Don't let the posters get wrinkled! And don't drink another one of those 'Nuclear' things!"
j "No promises on the drink! See ya, Sayori. Try not to choke on a snickerdoodle."

"She disappears into the swarm of people. Great. Now it's just me. I bet she's gonna eat her weight in free samples before she even makes it to the third floor."
"I pull my hoodie up and tuck the poster tube under my arm like a pro-bowler."
j "Alright, Jacko. Stealth mode. Don't look anyone in the eye. Don't get distracted by the smell of baked goods."
"I take a deep breath, winced at the caffeine jitters, and start weaving my way through the hallways."
j "Almost there... just don't let Monika see me shaking. I need to look cool, even if my heart is currently trying to exit through my ribcage."
