rj "She was just what? Being 'nice'? Being 'supportive'? She’s a control freak, Jacko! She’s the puppet master, and you were just another string! You were the 'Lead Visual Designer' because she needed a dog to fetch her markers!"

rj "Look at your hands, Jacko. They're shaking. Not from the 'Nuclear Battery,' but from the power of finally saying what you actually feel. It feels good, doesn't it? The honesty? The raw, unfiltered truth?"
rj "Everyone in that room is trash. Sayori is a bottomless pit of fake sunshine, a black hole wrapped in pink hair. Natsuki is a repressed brat who hides behind sugar because her real life is sour."

rj "This is the void. The nothingness. The absence of everything."
rj "Now listen, Jacko. I'm going to tell you about the levels of rizz."
rj "Level One: Unspoken Duke Dennis Rizz. The peak. The untouchable elite. The ones who get everything without asking. But that's just the beginning of the fall."
rj "Level Two: Rizz God. Still high up, but starting to slip. The confidence cracks. The desperation shows through the charm."
rj "Level Three: Rizzilisious. Mediocre success. Fake laughs, forced smiles. The mask is slipping, revealing the void underneath."
rj "Level Four: Incel Rizz. The turning point. Rejection after rejection. The anger builds. The entitlement grows. That's where you started feeling it, wasn't it?"
rj "Level Five: Rapist Rizz. The absolute bottom. The point of no return. Where you stop asking, stop caring, stop pretending. You just take what you want. No consent, no consequences, no humanity."
rj "That's where we're going, Jacko. We're descending through the levels, stripping away the pretense, until you're nothing but pure, unfiltered Rapist Rizz. The embodiment of rape rizz."
rj "That's me."
rj "That's what you're going to be."
rj "That’s my plan for you, Jacko. I’m going to strip away the 'friend', the 'visual designer', the 'student'. I’m going to leave nothing but the raw, unyielding hunger."
rj "You won't ask. You won't wait. You won't care. You’ll just... take. You'll take their attention, their fear, their very existence. You’ll be a force of nature."
j "I... I can't... that's not... that's not right..."
rj "Right? Wrong? Those are words for people with L-Rizz. People who need a social contract to feel safe. You’re raw, Jacko. You’re above the law. You’re above their reality."
rj "Look at those posters we made. All that 'Moe' crap. It’s a lie. It’s a mask. Why wear a mask when you can just show them the raw ass nigga underneath?"

j "Maybe... maybe you're right. They all looked at me like I was a hero for drawing those posters. But I'm not. I'm the guy who eats raw ramen because I don't have time for their 'functional' bullshit."
rj "There it is. The spark. Let it burn, Jacko. Let the whole school smell the bouillon of your rage. They want a club? Let's give them a club they'll never forget. Let's show them what happens when the prey stops running."
j "I'm raw. I'm a raw ass nigga. I don't need their 'Literature'. I don't need their 'Festival'. I don't need... her. I'm going to climb to the top. Supreme Rizz. Absolute control."
rj "Exactly. So what are we going to do next? Are we going to go back in there and finish what we started? Are we going to rip those posters off the walls and show them what 'Visual Design' really looks like?"

"I stop outside the clubroom door. I can hear them through the wood. Their voices sound like tinny radio transmissions, weak and pathetic."
n "And he just walked away after saying that to you? After all the help you gave him?"
n "What the hell is wrong with him? He was always a bit weird, but that was just... cruel. Monika, you shouldn't let him back in here. Ever."
"I hear a voice that is the most annoying voice I have ever heard. High pitched, judgmental, and coated in sugar that’s gone rotten."
"She'll be first."
"I reach the club room and push the door open. The sound of the hinges is like a scream."

n "You?! What are you doing back here?! Get out before I call—"
j "Shut up, Natsuki. Your voice sounds like a blender full of glass. I’m tired of hearing it."
"Natsuki recoils as if I’d slapped her. I don't stop. I walk straight to her precious cupcake display."
"I grab one. The frosting is a perfect, cutesy pink. I squeeze it. The cake crumbles, the cream oozing through my fingers like something dying."
j "This is your 'art', isn't it? Fluff and sugar. Just like you. No substance. Just a hollow shell hiding a bitter brat."
n "S-stop! Don't touch those! I worked so hard—"
j "Hard? You don't know the meaning of the word. You play with flour while I live on the edge. Everything is raw now, Natsuki."
"I sweep my arm across the table. Trays shatter as they hit the floor. Cupcakes smear into the carpet like colorful internal organs."
n "NO!"
"She lunges for me, her hands clawing. I don't even flinch. I grab her wrist. I can feel the bone underneath the skin. It’s so fragile."
j "Predatory Rizz, Natsuki. You’re the prey. And you’re not even a good challenge."
"I shove her back. She hits the desk hard, the corner catching her in the temple. She doesn't scream. She just slumps down into the pile of her ruined 'art'."
"One down. Two left. And the Puppet Master watching it all happen."
y "Jacko... please... this isn't logical. You’re experiencing a psychotic break—"
j "Logic? You want to talk about logic, Yuri? The girl who hides behind purple prose and sharp edges because she’s too scared to feel anything real?"
"I turn to her. She’s trembling. The 'mathematical beauty' she mentioned earlier is gone. She’s just a girl in a uniform, terrified of the raw truth standing in front of her."
j "You want to learn about my process? My process is simple. I strip away the lies until there’s nothing left but the meat."
"I grab the large banner we spent an hour hanging. I pull. The tape screams as it's ripped from the wall. I wrap the heavy fabric around my hand."
m "Jacko, stop! Please! We can help you! We can—"
j "You can’t help me, Monika. You can’t even help yourself. Watch."
"I move toward Yuri. She tries to run, but her legs give out. I’m on her in a second. The banner fabric is cold and rough against her skin."
y"N-no... help... Sayori—"
"I look over at Sayori. She’s frozen. Her 'sunshine' is gone. Her eyes are wide, glassy pits of horror."
j "Sayori! You wanted me to have friends, right? Look at us now. We’re closer than ever."
"I tighten the banner. Yuri’s face turns a dark, bruised purple. The same color as her hair. It’s a perfect match. Very aesthetically pleasing."
"..."
"Silence falls as she stops struggling. The room is quiet now. Just the flickering of the tea candles and the sound of my own heavy breathing."
"I look at Sayori. She’s backed into the corner, clutching a tray of her 'Reinforcement' chocolates."
s "Jacko... please... don't do this... I love you..."
j "Love? Love is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed, Sayori. It’s W-Rizz for the weak. I’m beyond that."
"I take a step toward her. She drops the tray. Chocolates scatter like birdseed."
j "You're a black hole, Sayori. You suck everyone into your misery and call it 'sunshine'. But there’s no light left in this room."
"I reach for her. She doesn't even fight. She just closes her eyes and waits. It’s pathetic. No fight. No raw energy. Just a hollow end."
"..."
"Three. The Literature Club is finally quiet."
"I turn to the last one. The President. The Puppet Master."
"Monika is shaking. Tears are streaming down her face, ruining the perfect image she’s worked so hard to maintain."
m "Why...? Why would you do this...? We were happy... it was supposed to be a dream..."
j "Dreams end when you wake up, Monika. And I’m wide awake."
"I start walking toward her. She backs toward the door. Her hand fumbles for the handle."
j "You’re the last one. The one who thought she could fix me. The one who thought she could control the Jackoing."
"She gets the door open. She lunges into the hallway, her shoes clicking frantically on the linoleum."
j "Run, Monika! Run as far as you can! But you’ll always hear the sound of me chasing you!"
"I stand in the doorway, watching her disappear around the corner. I could catch her. I could finish it right now."
"But I want her to live with it. I want her to look at every cutesy font, every polished poster, and every sweet cupcake and see the bouillon of my rage."
"I look back at the room. It’s a disaster. It’s a mess. It’s beautiful."
"It’s finally raw."
j "Damn. I'm hungry."
"I look at the bodies on the floor. They're all dead. They're all dead because of me."
